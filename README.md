# k-chess
My first chess application. First I will implement the 
game logic in python, then I will build out a front-end in JavaScript. Finally, I will build a chess engine to play against whoever wants a game! 

1. Python chess game. Board file contains the rules. 
2. Piece classes contain the legality of their moves, as well as their point value. 
3. FEN strings will be used to describe the state of the board.
